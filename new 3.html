The fortress at Uronarti was part of a string of fortresses built by Senusret III during a territorial expansion into Nubia during the 12th dynasty, aiding Egypt’s military and economic control of Nubia during the middle kingdom (Bestock, 2018). The fortress is an intriguing case study into the crises faced by archaeology today. The ways these crises have been responded to ensure that these sites can continue to be preserved and understood well into the future.

The first western archaeologist to conduct excavations at Uronarti was George Reisner and his team from the Boston Museum of Fine Arts (MFA). Reisner lead many sites throughout Egypt and the Sudan, and most of the daily work was led by Noel Wheeler. The fortress was excavated over two ‘frantic’ seasons between 1928 and 1930 (URAP, n.d.), with a focus on understanding the original use of Uronarti. Because of this, the plans of Uronarti drawn by Wheeler are limited to recording only what was believed to be a part of the original building phase of the fortress, rather than its entirety, due to a research focus on why the fortress was built. Limitations can be seen throughout the entirety of Wheeler’s recording, and most of the publications regarding Uronarti from this time. In many ways, the consequences of this still have an impact on excavations at Uronarti today, almost reaching the point of a Crisis. His notebooks “often have more extensive remarks about the car breaking down (…) than about the archaeology” (URAP, n.d.). This means that there is little first-hand information concerning the initial archaeological work at Uronarti, such there being no information regarding the original stratigraphy (URAP, n.d.) The final publications regarding Uronarti were written by Dows Dunham, curator at the MFA, as by this time Reisner had died and Wheeler had left the project in disgrace (Bestock, 2018). However, records of excavations at Uronarti are valuable for obtaining an initial understanding of the importance and use of the second cataract fortresses, given the relatively good condition the site was in at the time. The methods employed by Wheeler, while commonplace at the time, are considered outdated by today’s standards, occurring “early in the history of Egyptian archaeology (…) when methods and aims were rudimentary” (Knoblauch and Bestock, 2017). While there had already been erosion at Uronarti before Wheeler’s excavations (Reisner, 1929) and thus not a result of it, after his excavations “The site was not backfilled and has suffered badly from erosion ever since” (URAP, n.d.). Wheeler’s dumping methods are also representative of the time his excavation was conducted: these dumps overlaid several dumps from the time of the fort’s construction (Bestock, 2017). These dumps cannot be excavated today due to challenges posed by differing artefact collection standards. The changes and decay the site experienced as a result of these methods creates a crisis that must be responded to: managing the consequences of previous damage, and managing the potential for future damage.

However, Wheeler’s excavations were not the largest, nor most widespread, crisis that impacted Uronarti.

<h6>The Building of the Aswan High Dam, 1968</h6>
</center>
<br>
The flood created by the Aswan High Dam plunged many archaeological sites into crisis. The Dam was completed in 1970 and aided in regulating the yearly flood of the Nile River, irrigated land, and generated hydroelectric power.  Despite having many practical, political and economic benefits for Egypt, a known consequence was that the dam’s reservoir would create would destroy many ancient sites, including most prominently the Abu Simbel Temple. This created yet another crisis for Egyptologists: these sites would soon be gone, and thus any final excavations would have to be conducted quickly.  Many groups were mobilised in a response to this crisis, including the Egyptian Department of Antiquities (Joesten, 1960), and UNESCO. UNESCO’s ‘Nubia Campaign’ resulted in hundreds of sites being excavated and recorded, thousands of artefacts being retrieved, and most notably the relocation of many important temples (UNESCO, n.d.). However, this response was imperfect. The excavations undertaken have been described as being done “In great haste by rescue missions ahead of the advancing waters” (Knoblauch, Bestock and Makovics, 2013), implying that the work was not of a high standard because of the speed at which it was undertaken.

<h6>Moving the Abu Simbel Temple</h6>

Although relocating the temples was undoubtedly an effective response to ensure the preservation of world heritage, it reveals what aspects of heritage tend to be valued by the broader community, as opposed to what archaeologists value. 
<br>
<br>
The most iconic sites in Egypt are those that are relatively easy for the average person to get to and are relatively intact. These sites are often optimised for tourism and touted as highly “Instagrammable” (Homsy, 2023). If the public is able to fantasise about holidaying somewhere, they are more likely to care about preservation of the site: the more iconic a site, the more easily it can withstand a crisis due to increased public interest and the potential for tourist dollars to aid in a prompt and effective response. 
<br>
<br>
Therefore, the extent to which the sites impacted by the Aswan High Dam were and are in crisis depended on the public interest in them. Uronarti was a site that had already been explored in multiple seasons and therefore was simply left, with attention instead placed on the hundreds of sites that had not yet been excavated, or that were seen as more iconic and important.  The crisis experienced by the second cataract forts was greater than that experienced by many other sites, as they did not receive as comprehensive a response at the time of the dam’s completion. 
<br>
<br>
Despite several projections to the contrary (Bestock, 2018), it was believed that the second cataract fortresses, including Uronarti, were submerged beneath Lake Nubia. This “wholesale destruction” was “Mourned as one of the major losses to Nubian archaeology” (Knoblauch, Bestock and Makovics, 2013). There were few ways to respond to this, and little research was undertaken surrounding these fortresses, save for some studies, such as Smith (1995), conducted with unclear methodology and not properly addressing the crisis facing the sites they concern. However, in 2004 Derek Welsby published his finding that the fortresses at Uronarti and Shalfak had survived, asserting that “their survival into the 21st century provides a unique opportunity to undertake further research on these magnificent monuments”. Excavations at Uronarti began in 2012 and excavations at Shalfak began in 2017. These excavations respond to the crisis caused by the Aswan High Dam by recording information that was thought to be lost.

They go further than previous excavations by asking new research questions that aim to explore the broader contexts of the fortresses. Often these questions respond to other challenges posed by the fortresses’ environment, such as where fuel and mud came from to sustain the fort and its population (Bestock, 2018). Other investigations reinterpret historical assertions, such as whether Unit FA served as an administrative building or a temple (Bestock and Knoblauch, 2020). Another new avenue of research, the stages in which the fortress were built, prompts awareness of how the fortress has changed over time and thus encourages enquiries into the lives of the people who lived and worked at Uronarti (Bestock and Knoblauch, 2020; Bestock, 2018). These new elements of the understanding of Uronarti jointly respond to two of the biggest crises facing the site: asking additional questions that go beyond those of Wheeler and Reisner responds to a lack of comprehensive documentation regarding their work by creating a new bibliography of the site. Excavating what remains of the site after the Aswan High Dam’s construction and acknowledging where this is not possible responds to the destruction of many of the second cataract forts by recovering knowledge that was thought to have been washed away by the dam, improving understanding of the roles of these forts despite the crises they have faced in the last century.

<br>
However, there continues to be new crises that face Uronarti, necessitating new responses. Uronarti is located in present-day Sudan, a nation currently embroiled in civil war. This has two impacts on Uronarti: preventing excavations from being conducted, and directly threatening the site and its artefacts. Many western nations, including Australia, advise against all travel to Sudan due to the dangers posed by the civil war (Smartraveller, 2024). Consequently, it is impossible for work to be carried out presently. A greater threat is that posed to the site itself. If fighting breaks out in the area surrounding the fortress, it is likely to be damaged or destroyed. This is a crisis because of the destruction of cultural heritage, and potential responses are limited because of the circumstances: it is impossible to reach sites because of the danger; and accurate information about the extent of damage is limited due to the nature of conflict (Middle East Eye, 2024).

This crisis is not unique to Uronarti. Many other nations with significant heritage are currently embroiled in war and political instability. While there are many potential responses, such as recording through the EAMENA project or UNESCO-based advocacy, none are perfect. EAMENA is limited in scope, whereas UNESCO is limited in capacity. 
<br>
<br>
Despite continually facing crises, the fortress at Uronarti remains a unique historical site that provides rich knowledge about the frontiers of Egyptian society (Bestock, 2018). As it continues to weather crises into the future, the responses delivered will in many ways build its legacy.
